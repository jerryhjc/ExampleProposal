The preliminary SSSP Galois microarchitecture is already implemented and running within the Convey MX-100 FPGA platform 
in simulation. The remaining components of the proposed thesis and anticipated time to implement, test, and evaluate 
them are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Accurate Convey MX-100 memory timing simulator to aid evaluation - 1-2 weeks.
\item Run and tune SSSP implementation on Convey MX-100 with large data inputs - 2-3 weeks.
\item Design, implement, and evaluate worklist scheduling algorithms - 4-5 months.
\item Integrate Xiaoyu Ma's transactional memory algorithms within Galois uarch - 2-4 weeks.
\item Design, implement, and evaluate HLS algorithms for engine auto-generation - 2-3 months.
\item Miscellaneous integration, tuning, testing, and debugging - 1-2 months.
\item Writing of dissertation and preparing for thesis defense - 2 months.
\end{itemize}

In total, I anticipate roughly 12 to 15 months of work remain to complete the proposed work, 
produce the dissertation, and prepare for the thesis defense.
