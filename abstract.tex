\begin{abstract}

Although the behavior of irregular algorithms can be very complex, many of them have a generalized form of data 
parallelism known as \textit{amorphous data parallelism}. Through the use of unordered atomic transactions and 
dynamic worklist-based scheduling, the Galois system has been demonstrated to be a practical approach to exploiting 
this form of parallelism. I propose Galois for FPGA, an efficient custom microarchitecture and compiler to run 
Galois programs at higher performance and power efficiency than traditional general-purpose architectures.
